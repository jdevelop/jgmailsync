I have objects that represent logical relationships that can produce 
variable element names in a jibx binding. For example, I have an object 
called QueryComparisonSet that can produce elements with values like 
"and","or", or "not". The element name is actually stored in a field in 
the object. It doesn't look like there is a way to assign an element 
name from a field. I am assuming I need to write a custom serializer for 
this. I am very new to jibx so can you give me some idea of what the 
custom serializer might look like in this case.

Thanks,

Tammy
