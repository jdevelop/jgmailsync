Tammy,

I ran into the exact same issue. The way I worked around it is to use a
custom marshaller for the object.

JiBX is meant to be used for one Object to one Element mappings, and
technically if you are trying to deviate from that then you should be
using another marshalling framework. That being said, if almost all of
your objects have a one-to-one mapping with an element name (except for
a few), then a custom marshaller would make sense.

For more info, read

Subject: [jibx-users] variable element names

I have objects that represent logical relationships that can produce 
variable element names in a jibx binding. For example, I have an object 
called QueryComparisonSet that can produce elements with values like 
"and","or", or "not". The element name is actually stored in a field in 
the object. It doesn't look like there is a way to assign an element 
name from a field. I am assuming I need to write a custom serializer for

this. I am very new to jibx so can you give me some idea of what the 
custom serializer might look like in this case.

Thanks,

Tammy
